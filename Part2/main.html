	<h2>History</h2>
		<div class="body">
			<p>The origins of the game of badminton date back over 2000 years with roots in Greece, China, and India. Rackets were often made out of sanded down tree branches and horse hair. Tournaments drew in travelers from all around the world and teams competed for a variety of winnings including: livestock, slaves, petty cash and tubs of Nutella. Early competitions would involve the execution of the losing teams in tournaments, which were often made up of slaves owned by wealthy team owners. There is lots of running, not really, and hitting and waving the racket around in attempts to keep the other team from scoring. That's about it for the made up history of badminton, except the first sentence which is true, or so the internet tells me. These are some more words to fill the paragraph to look nice on this sophisticated html webpage. Badminton has brought enjoyment and entertainment to both viewers and 	players for over 2000 years.</p>
